# Some Kafka Connect Notes

Simple, all our sink and eventually source jobs will be defined here.

Note our MongoDB Atlast credentials are pulled in via a .pwdmongoatlas and .pwdmongolocal file executed by the cremongosinks.sh. This is to "exclude" the creds from the git sink. The creds are injected into the sinks using a simple environment variable.


The Sinks are split into 2 files, first file sink payloads into a local databasse hosted inside mongodb atlas container, instantiated via the docker-compose.yml deployment.

The second sink pushes the payloads into a MongoDB Atlas hosted database at your cloud provider of choice.
